In this experiment we use a Multi Channel Analyser (MCA) to measure the energy spectrum of the particles
emmitted in the nuclear decay process for C-137 and Co-60. The MCA is connected to a Scintillation detector which
produces low energy photons which go through a photo multiplier tube (PMT) to amplify the signal. The number of 
electrons produced is proportional to the energy of the incident gamma ray. An MCA is used to analyse an input signal 
consisting of voltage pulses. As evident from the title, it can scan for voltage pulses accross different voltage
channels. In our experiment, we had 1024 channels, each corresponding to a certain window of energy with
a fixed window size. We calibrated the MCA using the known values for the energy peaks for the decay 
of a Co-60 nucleus. 

A multichannel analyser stores information in one of two ways:

=== Pulse-Height Analysis

In pulse-height analysis mode (PHA), incoming pulses are characterised by their voltage ampitudes,
and hence, the output spectrum is a histogram, corresponding to number of pulses counted within a certain
window corresponding to each of the channels of the MCA. In this experiment, we used the MCA in PHA mode
to get a energy spectrum for the gamma ray emmision from the nuclear decay process.

=== Multichannel Scaling Mode
In Multichannel scaling (MCS) mode, the MCA doesn't differentiate between pulses of different voltage 
amplitudes. Hence, we only get a pulse count rate over time as an output. The MCA records the number of pulses
in a given channel first, for a fixed time interval, and then starts counting for the next channel for the next time interval
and so on.
