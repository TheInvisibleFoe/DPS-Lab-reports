We took 250 readings of the GM Counter at 10s operating at $825 V$. We then plotted a histogram 
and then plot a gaussian using the average and standard deviation we obtain 
from the data. From the data we obtain the mean $mu$ and standard deviation
$sigma$ using ,
$ EE[hat(X)] = mu, quad quad EE[(hat(X)-mu)^2] = sigma^2 $.
We obtain $mu = 71.40$ and $sigma = 8.53$. We then plot a gaussian function using the obtained mean and standard deviation.
