== Characteristic Curve Data

To obtain the characteristics curve of the Geiger muller counter we vary the voltage over a range,
from $0 V$ to $1300 V$ till the first point of continuous discharge. The data has been provided in the 
supplementary.

== Characteristic Curve Plot
Here is the characteristic curve plot for the GM counter using a sodium source.

We set the operating voltage of the Geiger Muller counter in the mid point of the Geiger Muller
Plateau , which is given by $ V_(o p) = (400 + 1250)/(2) V = 825 V $ The second part of the experiment
was counting statistics for GM counter, which was done at the operating voltage of $V_(o p) = 825 V$
