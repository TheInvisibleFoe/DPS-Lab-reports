+ We did not measure the background radiation. This may cause an error in our measurements of the counts of the electric pulses.
+ Any electrical disturbances in the setup could contribute to some error in the measurement.
+ The distributions around the peak may not be perfectly gaussian. Also, the way we have fitted the gaussians, they effect each others amplitudes, which may also lead to an error.
+ The standard deviation due to the fit of the centroids in the graph, can be safely ignored since they are smaller than 1.
+ The least count of the voltage dial in the PMT setup was 3 Volts. This can also lead to innacuracies in the measurement of the photopeak resolution for varying PMT voltages.
