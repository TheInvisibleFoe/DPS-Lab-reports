+ A primary source of error is the comparitively high dead time of a Geiger-Mueller counter. This is a greater source of error for the Strontium source, due to the higher count rate. Any $beta$ radiation that is incident on the GM counter during the dead time will not trigger a series of Townsend avalanches and will not be registered as a count.
+ The efficiency of response of the GM counter is also a function of the energy of the incident radiation, and this introduces a systematic error into the spectrum that is being recorded.
+ Non-uniformity in the magnetic field created by passing current through the conducting coil can cause errors. Since the region where the $beta$ radiation is being emitted and captured lie outside of the solenoid, the field is not uniform. We have not accounted for the edge corrections in the magnetic field near the ends of a finite length solenoid, and thus these errors are present in the spectra that we have recorded.
+ Electrical fluctuations that might affect the counting equipment and the power sources used in the experiment are a source of error.
+ The $beta$ radiation particles also undergo some amount of energy straggling as they travel from the source to the GM counter, as the space between them is not an evacuated vaccuum. It is reasonable to expect different $beta$ particles to have undergone different histories and thus have lost differing amounts of energy in the space between the detector and the source. This causes the spectra readings to be more diffuse than they ideally should be.
+ The assumption that the entire conical solid angle in which the radiation source puts out $beta$ particles has the same number density of the particles is erroneous, as we have not accounted for geometric factors such as the positioning of the radioactive material in the source. If the number density of $beta$ particles at some angle from the center of the cone (measured over a long enough period of time) changes as a function off the angle, this would introduce errors into the spectra that we have measured.
