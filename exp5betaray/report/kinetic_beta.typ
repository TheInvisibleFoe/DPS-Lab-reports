We use a Geiger-Muller counter to measure the energy of the gamma-ray emitted by the sources. Now, GM counters arent designed to measure energy since, in the Geiger Muller region of the characteristics curve, all energy information is lost. 
The spectrometer schema is laid out above. We find the relation between the counts and the energy of the beta-ray. Let us now derive the energy of the beta ray. The relativistic energy equation is given by:
$ E= sqrt(p^2c^2 + m_0 c^4)  $
where $p$ is the momentum of the beta particle, $m_0$ is the rest mass of the beta particle,$E$ is the total energy of the beta particle and $c$ is the speed of light. 

We also have $E = T+V = T+m_0 c^2$. Using this, we can write the above equation as:
$ T = sqrt(p^2 c^2 + m_0 c^4) - m_0c^2 $
We place the beta source in a magnetic field and use the value for the average radius of curvature $r$ to equate the Lorentz force with the centripetal force($m v^2\/r$). This gives us: 
$ (m v^2)/r = q(E+v B) = q v B => p = m v = q B r $ where $q$ is the charge of the beta particle. Useing this in the above equation, we get:  
$ T = sqrt((q B r c)^2 + m_0 c^4) - m_0 c^2 $
